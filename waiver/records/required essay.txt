Greetings fellow organisms made of flesh and blood! Today I will be talking about the groups of people who spent many periods of twenty-four hours to try to earn the permission to use their meaty brains to move their hands to write on a piece of paper to vote for who got to be president/governer/mayor of their region of the United States of America. This multiple-paragraph-styled essay will make your brain create connections so you will understand the troubles of people who could not have opinions.


In the 1800th year through 1900th year, there was a not very good thing that existed. Only caucasian male landowners could use their brains to decide what was good or bad for people who ruled their region of the United States of America. This resulted in the fact that no African Americans nor Native Americans nor any women could use their brains to vote. After many periods of 24 hours, they decided to do a thing that would do something.


After many periods of three-hundred and sixty-four periods of twenty-four hours, African Americans and Native Americans and women were able to choose who they wanted as their leaders too!


After all of these over-complicated paragraphs, I guess I could say, to get what you want, you should argue.
