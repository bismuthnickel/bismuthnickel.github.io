Today I have used my neurons in order to decide whether or not I should use my vocal cords in a satisfactory manner to create vibrations that will travel through the air at supersonic speeds to reach your eardrums in order to get a reaction in your brain that will create a chemical called dopamine. So far, my brain, a giant pile of meat with electrical currents to form thoughts, is pointing to yes. So focus your attention to the vibrations from my </span><span class="c0">vocal</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cords coming out of my mouth, and let us commence with the groups of sentences that will pique your </span><span class="c0">interest</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, Robert was using his legs to move forward towards the direction of home. As he was transporting, he tripped on an </span><span class="c0">igneous</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rock, most likely formed deep inside the earth, that was inside of the concrete. His chin hit the ground at a high speed, and he ran home at a very fast acceleration. As soon as he arrived at his destination, he informed his mother of his chin by saying, &quot;Mother. I am losi</span><span class="c0">ng blood at an alarming rate and</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;would be most grateful if you, my caretaker and guardian, would transport me to the nearest hospital so we can help heal my wounds, so I can continue this mortal journey instead of ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.&quot; His mother immediately used her hands to grab a telecommunications device, and press the buttons in the order of 9-1-1 to get the ambulance to drive to their house. Once arrived at the hospital, Robert got stitches inserted to the massive wound on his chin, so it could heal.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 14.98px 7.73px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.13rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.13rad) translateZ(0px); width: 242.00px; height: 136.00px;"><img alt="" src="image1.jpg" style="width: 320.00px; height: 180.00px; margin-left: -39.00px; margin-top: -22.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the next period of 24 hours, Robert went to the place of expanding knowledge on topics such as math, reading and science. All of Robert&#39;s companions in school came over to him to ask him how the giant wound on his chin appeared yesterday after school. Robert then used his vocal cords to get the story of how he tripped on the </span><span class="c0">igneous</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rock on the sidewalk across. His friends were </span><span class="c0">in awe</span><span class="c0 c2">. Over time, Robert&#39;s wound healed, and he got his stitches removed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank </span><span class="c0">you</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;for listening to the many vibrations I created to get my story into your brain.</span></p></body></html>
